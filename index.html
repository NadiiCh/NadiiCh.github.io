      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>The term ellipsis refers to a phenomenon when a part of syntactic material is missing in the sentence, as presented below:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>He wanted to surprise Kate, but he didn't know how [to surprise her].</li>
          <li>Jack didn't read the book, but I did [read the book].</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Interestingly, although some material is elided, the meaning of both sentences is preserved. This is possible due to an antecedent. For instance, an antecedent for 'I did [read the book]' is the rightmost part of the sentence, namely 'Jack didn't read the book'.</p>

    <div id="classification">
      <h2>Classification</h2>
      <p>We can group ellipsis according to how much syntactic material is elided:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Predicate (verbal) ellipsis</strong> - a type of ellipsis, in which a predicate is missing:
              <div class="example">
                  <p>She has never been to Rome but Ivan has [been to Rome].</p>
                  <p>Kate watched this film, but Anne didn't [watch this film].</p>
              </div>
          </li>
  
          <li><strong>Clausal ellipsis</strong> - a type of ellipsis, in which an entire clause is missing:
              <div class="example">
                  <p>Jack bought something, but I don't know what [Jack bought].</p>
                  <p>A: What did you eat? <br>B: [I ate] A banana.</p>
              </div>
          </li>
  
          <li><strong>Nominal ellipsis</strong> - a type of ellipsis, in which a head noun is missing:
              <div class="example">
                  <p>Polish: Kasia lubi francuskie filmy, a Ania lubi tylko w≈Çoskie [filmy].</p>
                  <p>Translation: 'Kate likes French movies, and Anne likes only Italian [movies].'</p>
              </div>
          </li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  
        
    <div class="info">
        <p><strong> Info!</strong> Although there is no theoretical background that would support this classification, it can be found in various publications on ellipsis.</p>
